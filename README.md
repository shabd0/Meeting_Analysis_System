# Meeting_Analysis_System
 AI Meeting Analysis System — an end-to-end pipeline that listens, analyzes, and generates intelligent recommendations from real meetings.


AI Meeting Analysis & Recommendation System

This project is an AI-powered system that listens, understands, and analyzes meeting conversations, then generates intelligent recommendations for communication improvement and productivity.

🚀 Project Overview

The system takes a meeting audio recording between multiple speakers (e.g., a manager and an employee) and performs a full end-to-end analysis pipeline:

1️⃣ Voice Diarization — separates speakers in the meeting.

2️⃣ Speech-to-Text Conversion — transcribes the meeting into text using models like Whisper or Wav2Vec2.

3️⃣ Meeting Feature Extraction — detects Goals, Achievements, Challenges, and Feedback using custom fine-tuned models.

4️⃣ AI Recommendation Generation — uses Mistral-7B-Instruct (a Large Language Model) to produce a structured summary and improvement suggestions.

🧩 Features

✅ Automatic speaker separation (Voice Diarization)

✅ Speech-to-text transcription

✅ Multi-model classification for Goals / Achievements / Challenges / Feedback

✅ Fine-tuned Hugging Face models for high accuracy

✅ Smart, structured recommendations generated by Mistral-7B

✅ Outputs CSV reports with scores and detected insights
